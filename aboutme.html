      <h1>Hi, I'm Michael Levey.</h1>
      
      <p><em>Full-time University of Florida Student, evaluating issues facing society on a day-to-day basis.</em></p>
      
      <p>My name is Michael Levey, and I am a third year Telecommunications/Media and Society major with a minor in History and a Specialization in Political Science at the University of Florida’s College of Journalism and Communications.  I was born and raised in Miami, Florida, and spend most of my summers enjoying the tropical life of South Florida.  I am pre-law, and hope to attend law school after I graduate in 2015. </p> 

<p>I stay active in several organizations on Florida’s campus.  My freshman year, I represented my Greek organization for the Unite Party, a student political party on campus.  That year, I was also selected as the Director of Swamp Symphony, a Gator Growl & Homecoming Event that has evolved into Gators Jazz & Blues Fest.  I have also been apart of the Staff for Accent Speakers Bureau, serving as the Director of Productions my sophomore year, and Director of Website/Technology my junior year.  I have also served as the new member educator for my Greek Organization, teaching the morals and values of my organization to new members seeking to join the organization.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2013, I interned for Beber Silverstein Group, shadowing Public Relations President Leslie Pantín, while working closely with members of the Public Relations team.  I also sat in on “creative” meetings for potential public relations campaigns, thinking for creative advertising strategies for companies like Carnival and McDonalds.  </p>

<p>Outside of class and work, I enjoy playing basketball, softball and football with friends.  As an avid sports fan, I try to watch significant sporting events in Golf as well as tennis.  I am an avid Gators football fan as well as an avid supporter of all Miami sports, going to Heat games and Dolphins and Canes football games since a very young age. </p> 

<p>I am a devoted follower of several shows on Television, including South Park, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Homeland, Silicon Valley, Veep, Suits, and many more.  I try to find time to read as well, recently reading books such as Unbroken, George Washington’s Secret Six: The First American Spy Ring and The Man in the White Sharkskin Suit.</p>

<p>In High School, I played alto saxophone and served as the Drum Major for my High School marching band.  Music still has a special place in my heart, and I continue to express my love for music in my personal blog.  I have always had a deep passion for the arts, specifically music and film.  I consider myself a professional Spotify user, with a wide range of playlists featuring Jazz and Classic Rock to contemporary music playlists featuring Rap, EDM, and Indie music.  Some of my favorite movies of all time include The Godfather Part 2, The Godfather, The Usual Suspects, Silence of the Lambs, and Almost Famous – in that specific order.
