      <h1>Hi, I'm Michael Levey.</h1>
      
      <p><em>Full-time University of Florida Student, evaluating issues facing society on a day-to-day basis.</em></p>
      
      <p>A Junior from Miami majoring in Telecommunications and minoring in History at the University of Florida. I have always had a deep passion for the arts, specifically music and film. I have been playing the alto saxophone for over 10 years, and have an avid desire to get back in touch with the arts. I consider myself a professional Spotify user, with a range of playlists from Jazz and Classic Rock to contemporary music playlists with EDM and Indie music.</p>
